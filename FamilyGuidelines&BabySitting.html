      <h5><b>Pre-booked babysitting service 7pm-1am</b></h5>
      <p>
        <b>Responsibilities</b> <br />• Babysitters must have been pre-booked
        prior to the weekend with Tanya Gabbitas <br />• The babysitting manager
        will be at Reception <br />• Please meet the babysitting manager from
        6:30pm on Saturday evening to review the completed booking form and
        ensure they have your exact requirements <br />• All children must be in
        pyjamas and in bed before the babysitters take responsibility <br />•
        Babysitters will be outside the bedrooms. Please ensure that you prop
        the door open and leave a key with them, as each babysitter will be
        covering more than one room <br />• Parents must always be contactable -
        babysitters will call the parents if their child wakes up and does not
        settle <br />• Parents must return to the room promptly (1am) -
        babysitters cannot finish duty until you return <br />• Once the
        babysitter has finished, we strongly recommend you do not leave your
        children unattended in the room. Unattended children are your
        responsibility <br /><br /><b>Movie and games rooms</b> <br />• The
        children’s movie and games rooms will be supervised by the babysitters
        <br />• Young children must be signed in and out of these rooms <br />•
        The games room has an open-door policy (children can come in/out)
        <br />• It is the parent’s responsibility to ensure that their child is
        happy to stay in these rooms and they are not wandering round the hotel
        unaccompanied <br />• Snacks/cordial and water will be available
        throughout
